# Autonomous Agent using Q-Learning

##  Objective
Build a basic 2D agent that navigates from start to goal while avoiding obstacles using Q-learning.

##  How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install pygame numpy
    ```

2. Run the main file:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

##  ML Technique Used
- **Q-Learning**
  - Reward shaping
  - Epsilon-greedy policy
  - State: agent position
  - Actions: [Up, Down, Left, Right]

##  Logging
- Total reward per episode
- Epsilon decay
- Visualization every 50 episodes
